If you have not reached legal adulthood, your legal guardian will need to agree or sign this agreement, with special attention paid to the terms for minors.\n\n
1 Scope of the agreement\n
1.1 This agreement is a contract between the user (hereinafter referred to as 'you') and LNN regarding the use of LNN's hardware and software products and other related matters.\n
1.2 You expressly declare and guarantee that you have sufficient legal rights or authorization to sign and fulfill the terms of the LNN User Agreement; your signing and fulfilling of the LNN User Agreement will not conflict with any other agreements or arrangements to which you are obligated, nor will it result in a breach of contract. To use LNN products, if you encounter obstacles including but not limited to the following: not reaching full civil liability status, not obtaining valid authorization, conflicts between this agreement and your other statutory or contractual obligations, etc., please thoroughly eliminate the obstacles and restore your eligibility to sign and fulfill the agreement first.\n
1.3 You also guarantee that the terms of the LNN User Agreement are legally binding on you and enforceable when necessary. To use LNN products, you must be of legal age, therefore, using LNN products is deemed as your acknowledgment that you are older than the legal age. If you are under the legal age, before deciding whether to use LNN products, please read the terms of this agreement with your parents or legal guardian to ensure that they fully understand the content of the terms. We recommend that parents or legal guardians provide supervision and guidance to their underage children when using LNN products.\n\n
2 LNN services are provided to you in two ways:\n
one is to provide you with LNN services as easily as possible when you use your LNN products; The other is the LNN service over the Internet. Depending on the LNN products you own, the services provided by LNN may vary, and not all featured services are available. Please refer to the user manual of your product for specific details.\n\n
3 Software updates\n
3.1 In order to achieve timely repair of user issues and improve user experience, we will collect information on the type, model, system and software version numbers, MAC addresses, and IP addresses of LNN hardware devices to provide you with software upgrade notifications and automatic update functions.\n
3.2 LNN devices provide you with online software updates, including but not limited to updating or upgrading code and other embedded software, documents, interfaces, content, fonts, and any data stored on LNN devices. This update or upgrade requires a network connection, and any data fees that may be incurred due to networking will be directly charged by the operator. For details, please consult your operator. If you need to disable this feature, you can set it up in the system by logging into the management interface. However, please be aware that disabling this feature will not automatically upgrade the software system of your LNN device. When manually upgrading, it may be difficult for you to determine the current compatible software version of the device in a timely manner, which may affect your product experience.\n
3.3 In emergency situations, LNN will download and install important update software for your device to ensure its stable operation. This feature is enabled by default on some devices. If you need to disable this feature, you can set it to turn off cloud services in the system by logging into the management interface.\n
3.4 During the upgrade process, if there is a power outage or a very low probability of hardware failure, it may cause the device system to fail to start normally and automatically enter recovery mode. In recovery mode, the default is to use the network settings you used when browsing the internet normally, in order to download software from the server to complete the repair. We will fix it with the latest updated software version.\n
3.5 You understand and agree that the specific service content of this upgrade service will be provided to you by LNN according to the 'current situation' and 'existing'.

If you use the platform management function to connect your device, there are corresponding 'user agreements' and 'personal information protection policies' for the WEB entrance, client entrance, and mobile APP entrance of the relevant platform services. Please read the relevant agreements and policies first. If you choose 'agree and continue', it will be deemed that you accept such agreements and policies and agree to be bound by the terms of the agreements and policies.
